<p>According to a survey conducted in mid-2020, about a quarter of people would not get a vaccine for COVID-19, most them worrying about side effects and suspecting the effectivenss of the shots (Boyon, 2020). Georgraphically, Eastern European countries such as around 40% of people in Hungary and Poland somewhat or strongly disagree to the statement “If a vaccine for COVID-19 were available, I would get it”; South Africa and Russia also had a signficant disapproval or skepticism among their populations (Guàrdia & Hirsch, 2020). We expect our data to be aligned with these insights and provide more information about their cause of skepticism.
